1. Project's Title : Module 5 Practical Application
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the coding objectives taught during Modules 1 -5. Create a GitHub account, use a text editor, understand how to stage and commit to GitHub, and run code in Juypter without errors.

2. Project Description
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not. The dataset provided is called "coupons". The objective is to determine which customers accepted the coupons given to them during transist. The clean dataset contains 12610 rows Ã— 26 columns. 

4. How to Install and Run the Project
I installed GitBash and VS and used both to see which one I liked using. I also created a GitHub account and created a public facing folder: UC Berkeley Module 5 Pratice Application. The public facing URL is: https://github.com/ahovermill/UC-Berkeley-Module-5-Practice-Application


5. How to Use the Project
First open the Power Point presentation "Hovermill Module 5 Executive Summary". This will give you an idea of the project and information in the Hovermill Modue 5.jypnb file.
Ensure you have Juypter Notebook or Visual Studio Code loaded in order to open the attached jypnb file. 
Open the Hovermill Module 5.jypnb file 

6. Feedback
Please leave feedback on how I can improve my coding skills. I am new at coding using Python and displaying plots and graphs.

Thank you
